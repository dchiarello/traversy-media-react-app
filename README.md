# React Learning Project

Wanted to start learning react and came up with this simple application.

## Resources

Main resource was this awesome video from Traversy Media on Youtube:

React JS Crash Course 2021 [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)

Additional Resources i've used:

- How to use Git inside of VSCode [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2DBSH2VoHQ)
- The Beginner's guide to React [Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) (it's a free course, and it's great!)
- Official React [Here](https://reactjs.org/)
- Official React Router [Here](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Development Tools

- JSON Server [Here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More
